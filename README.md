**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Ryan So

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/codepath-prework-light-and-sound?path=index.html%3A4%3A26

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] I changed the time that the hint plays for in order to speed up gameplay.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

Not applicable - I used no outside resources.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

A challenge I encountered in creating my submission was figuring out how the different files interacted with each other. More specifically, how HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files are supposed to be formatted in relation to each other in order to work together to create a webpage. For example, HTML files determine the webpage’s visual layout, such as where text and buttons are located. However, a button’s functionality is encoded within the project’s JavaScript file, and thus the JavaScript file must be directly correlated with what is written in the HTML file in order to ensure the proper functionality of all buttons and links. In addition, the CSS file is used for styling the webpage, so the appearance of buttons and bodies are entirely dependent on the code written within the CSS file. I find it fascinating that in web development, a developer must be fully aware of the structure and functionality of all three files in order to ensure that the project functions correctly. In order to overcome this challenge, I changed specific elements of each page independently and observed how the site changed as a whole. For example, I changed the code correlating to the start button on the JavaScript file to see if it impacted the functionality of the button, which it did. In addition, I changed the code corresponding to the start button in the CSS file to see how it impacted the style of the button on the page. In all, I now know that all three files must work together in parallel to function correctly on the site.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After this brief project, I still have many questions about web development. First, in a general sense, what practices have been known to increase appeal to a web page. I understand that appeal to any particular thing is subjective, but what design and development practices have larger corporations subtly implemented to increase appeal to their sites? A less general question I have is how does one develop a site with registered users? For example, social media sites require individuals to register for an account and be logged into these accounts to use the site. Where are users’ information stored and how do I develop a site that creates and stores account information? I would very much like to have this question answered as I could definitely see myself developing a networking site of some sort. Another question I have is how do you develop sites that show advertisements? What steps go into getting companies to advertise on your site and what does the development process look like? Finally, my last question would be how do streaming sites stream live videos? Where are these videos coming from and what is done on the software side to take a physical recording in live time and display it on a website? In all, these are the major questions I have about web development and would like to learn about and improve upon.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on the project, I would likely make the interface more appealing. Although the interface is completely functional, it does look a bit simplistic, and just a few hours of work would likely yield a much more sophisticated looking product. If I had the time, I would want to learn how to add a time function, an account function, and a leaderboard function. Then, users can keep track of their best times and compete against each other. In all, I think that these small additions would increase the website’s appeal dramatically.  If I was able to complete all of that, I would want to monetize the site with advertisements relating to the game itself, perhaps advertising other sites with similar content so that users can have a broader experience elsewhere online. Although these goals are all quite aspirational, I believe they’d make the site amazing.
